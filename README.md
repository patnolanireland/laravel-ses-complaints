This package listens to AWS SNS notifications and stops sending mail to email addresses that have received a permanent bounced notification or users who have marked an email as spam.

## How it works

This package intercepts each mail sent by your laravel application and check if 
the receiver has not marked your mail as SPAM or if the user email address received 
a permanent bounce notification from AWS SNS before. And according to your strategy
defined in the [config file](#config-file), it stops the email sending process or sends the email.

## Installation

Before the installation process, please refer to the version mapping table below to ascertain compatibility between `laravel-ses-complaints` package version and your Laravel application:

| Package Version | Laravel Version |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| v2.0.0          | 11              |
| v1.0.0          | 9 & 10          |
| v0.0.4          | 9               |
| v0.0.3          | 9               |
| v0.0.2          | 8               |

Ensure you select the appropriate version that corresponds with your Laravel version to guarantee full functionality and compatibility.

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require oza75/laravel-ses-complaints
```
### Publish migrations files and config file
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Oza75\LaravelSesComplaints\LaravelSesComplaintsServiceProvider"
```
### Run migration
```bash
php artisan migrate
```
This command will create 2 tables in your database. `sns_subscriptions` table for sns subscription confirmation request 
and `ses_notifications` table to store complaint and bounce notifications received from SNS.

## Usage

### Create SNS topics
Go to your AWS SNS console and create two HTTP/S topic with these endpoints: 
- https://yourapp.tld/aws/sns/ses/bounces  listen to bounce notifications
- https://yourapp.tld/aws/sns/ses/complaints  listen to complaint notifications

These endpoints can be customized in the [config file](#config-file). Note that as soon as you create
these endpoints, they will be automatically confirmed. If not, you can use `php artisan aws:sns:subscribe-url` command to print out 
the `SubscribeURL` required to confirm subscription directly in your aws console. [More details](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/SendMessageToHttp.confirm.html)

### Create SNS topics
Add SNS topics to your SES domain. [More details](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/configure-sns-notifications.html)
